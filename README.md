# 🎂✨ Happy Birthday Website ✨💻
A Code-Powered Birthday Surprise for Someone Truly Special

# 🌟 About This Project
I, Sansha Ikbal, created this interactive birthday website for someone very close to my heart to make their day unforgettable! It features:

   🎨 A beautifully decorated birthday card at the center.
   🎂 A big animated cake with cheerful GIFs and sparkle.
   ✨ Elegant "Happy Birthday" calligraphy that adds a magical touch.
   💌 A heart-shaped message icon that reveals a loving greeting when clicked.
This site is fully responsive, heartfelt, and crafted with love. 💖

# 🚀 Why I Built This
   Because sending a basic birthday message isn’t my style — I wanted to express my feelings through creativity and code. ❤️
This is more than a project — it’s a digital gift, straight from my heart to hers.
